Employee Stay or Leave Prediction using Machine Learning

# Employee Stay or Leave Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether an employee will stay in the company or leave, 
based on HR dataset features such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, 
number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent in company, etc.

The model is built using Machine Learning techniques in Python.
